title: Roadmap

Tempest is still a <span class="hl-attribute">work in progress</span>, this page outlines the next milestones. You're more than welcome to [contribute to Tempest](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework), you can even work on features in future milestones if anything is of particular interest to you. The best way to get in touch about Tempest development is to [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/pPhpTGUMPQ).

## 1.0-alpha2

- Authentication and authorization
- `str` and `arr` helpers
- Cache
- Internal kernel refactor
- Ability to skip any file from discovery

## 1.0-alpha3

- Filesystem
- Improved route regex support
- Vendor file publishing
- Async commands

## Next alphas

Depending on the feedback from the first two alpha versions, we might opt into adding more alpha versions before 1.0.

## 1.0 and beyond

There's no hard deadline on when Tempest 1.0 should be tagged. It's clear that we'll have to wait until PHP 8.4 has been released, though it could be a couple of months longer still.

The following features will be **included in Tempest 1.0**:

- **MVC support**
- **Console application support**
- **ORM and database support**
- **Event bus**
- **Command bus**
- **Logging**
- **Mapping and validation**
- **Tempest Views**

Tempest 1.0 will be a lightweight version of the framework, with several useful features still missing. We plan on added features like queue management and mail support in subsequent minor versions:

- 1.1: **auth, htmx support, improved form support, and app events**
- 1.2: **queue manager**
- 1.3: **mail support**
- 1.4: **Event bus improvements, possibly with ES support**
